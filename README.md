### Hello~

I'm currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at UC San Diego. 

I'm currently working on an indie game called *Delivery Rush*, where you, the player, have a limited time to deliver pizzas to mythical beings in the town of Drakovia. I am also working on *Sleep Buddies*, a web application designed to support healthy sleep habits. Users can track their sleep patterns, receive insightful sleep reports, enjoy calming pre-sleep music, engage in guided meditation, and set personalized reminders for bedtime routines.

### Access to Private Repositories
Some of my projects and code are private due to ongoing development or specific requirements. If you’re interested in viewing any of these projects as part of the hiring process, please reach out to me, and I’d be happy to grant temporary access.
