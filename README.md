### Hello~

I'm currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at UC San Diego. 

I'm currently working on an indie game called *Delivery Rush*, where you, the player, have a limited time to deliver pizzas to mythical beings in the town of Drakovia. I am also working on *Sleep Buddies*, a web application designed to support healthy sleep habits. Users can track their sleep patterns, receive insightful sleep reports, enjoy calming pre-sleep music, engage in guided meditation, and set personalized reminders for bedtime routines.
